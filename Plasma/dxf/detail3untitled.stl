// Module names are of the form poly_<inkscape-path-id>().  As a result,
// you can associate a polygon in this OpenSCAD program with the corresponding
// SVG element in the Inkscape document by looking for the XML element with
// the attribute id="inkscape-path-id".

// fudge value is used to ensure that subtracted solids are a tad taller
// in the z dimension than the polygon being subtracted from.  This helps
// keep the resulting .stl file manifold.
